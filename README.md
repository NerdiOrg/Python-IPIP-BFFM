# Python-IPIP-BFFM

Python script (single file) for command line IPIP BFFM test. Useful for personal tests or professional settings.

The IPIP BFFM (International Personality Item Pool Big Five Factor Markers) personality test is universally recognized as an established standard and assessment evaluation method. The general consensus in academic psychology is that there are five fundamental personality traits. This model is assumed in most personality research, and is the basis of many of the most well regarded tests employed by psychologists who maintain close connections with academia. The "big five" tend to not be popular in consumer focused personality assessment or self-help because to many people the feedback of the model seems relatively basic. This test uses public domain scales from the International Personality Item Pool.
